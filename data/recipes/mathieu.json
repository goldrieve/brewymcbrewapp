Allow yeast to continue until finished. Do not allow temperature to drop. If yeast seems to be stalling, do not be afraid to raise temperature as high as 24C to ensure proper attenuation. Assume fermentation is done if the gravity does not change over ~3 days. \n\nRack to a bright tank that has been purged with CO2 to avoid oxygen pickup, add 1 tsp of unflavoured gelatin dissolved in a cup of hot distilled water per 19 litres of beer, and allow to clear for 2-3 days. Package as you would normally. Rack to kegs that have first been purged with CO2 and then chill the kegs to near freezing while carbonating at the same time in a conditioning fridge. After ~1-2 weeks at serving pressure the kegs will be carbonated and ready to serve. In a hurry? Feel free to raise the CO2 pressure temporarily to 30-40 PSI to carbonate fast over a 24 period, and then turn back down to serving pressure. Carbonate this beer to higher than normal levels, around 2.5 to 3.5 volumes of CO2. The beer will improve if conditioned just above freezing for 4 weeks before serving and will continue to change over time. Sampling is recommended."

Take the prepared elderberries and place them in the straining bag inside the sanitised fermenting bucket. Use a potato masher to thoroughly crush the berries. It should be noted they will stain so try not to get any on your clothes. Your straining bag will never be the same colour after making elderberry wine!\n\n3. Pour the boiling water over the crushed elderberries and give them a good stir. Allow to cool for a few hours and then add the yeast nutrient, acid blend and the crushed Campden tablet. Mix thoroughly, cover and fit the airlock and wait for at least 12 hours.\n\n4. After 12 hours add the pectic enzyme mix thoroughly and wait for a further 24 hours.\n\n5. After 24 hours add the yeast onto the surface of the must, there is no need to stir. Cover and fit the airlock and patiently wait for fermentation to begin.\n\n6. Stir the wine daily for the first week of fermentation, after 2 weeks lift out the straining bag and allow the wine to drain from the berries. Avoid squeezing the bag.\n\n7. Leave the wine to settle for a day and then syphon the wine into a demijohn. You may check the gravity now if you have a hydrometer. The wine should be close to, if not fully fermented out.\n\n8. Allow the wine to condition in the demijohn for at least 3 ? 4 months, racking when any sediment builds up. After conditioning for at least 3 ? 4 months you should sample the wine. You may want to back sweeten the wine if you prefer a sweeter taste if so follow this guide before bottling. If not rack straight to bottles and try to keep hold of them for as long as possible.\n\nElderberry wine ages very well and will continually evolve so try and hold onto a few bottles for a year or more. You will be pleasantly surprised at how good an elderberry wine can get."

(2:1 chloride\nto sulfate ratio (200 ppm Cl, 100 ppm SO4)) Hop Schedule - Just after knockout toss in the first set\nof knockout hops and begin the whirlpool process. - After 20 minutes have gone past after knockout,\nreduce wort temperature to 170 \u00b0F (77 \u00b0C) (or 150/66) and then add the second set of hops to the hop\nstand and once again whirlpool. - After 15 more minutes have passed, begin final cooling process.\nFermentation Dry hop is really up to preference. I typically like to do 6oz total broken up into 2\nseparate dry hops (3oz and 3oz). I?ve done 3oz first dry hop and the last in the keg which worked\nwell. Add half of dry hops in 2-3 days, when the krausen is still high. 4-6 days later, when\nfermentation is mostly done, rack into a secondary on top of vanilla bean and fruit puree. Allow to\ncondition on the fruit alone for 4-6 days, then add the rest of the dry hops. Cold crash and package\n4-7 days later.\nHOPS\nSensory differences between the different temperatures showed that beers late-hopped at 203 \u00b0F (95 \u00b0C)\nscored highest for citrusy, spicy, and ester descriptors. The 185 \u00b0F (85 \u00b0C) late hop temperature\nscored higher for floral and herbal descriptors. The 167 \u00b0F (75 \u00b0C) hop addition scored the lowest in\nnearly every category except for the sylvan (woody) characteristic.11 Lowering the temperature of the\nwhirlpool will also lower the isomerization of alpha-acids to iso-alpha-acids, potentially allowing\nfor larger hop additions for flavor vs. bitterness. | Laval St-Rose 2018 (Hoppy NEIPA)\nCa 114 Mg 9 Na 6 Cl 157 SO 83\n\nSO/Cl ratio: 0.5\nMash pH: 5.25\n\n20L\nCaSO4 = 1.8g\nCaCl2 = 6g\nMgSO4 = 1.7g\nNaCl = 0.1g\n\n15L\nCaSO4 = 1.35g\nCaCl2 = 4.5g\nMgSO4 = 1.275g\nNaCl = 0.075g"
